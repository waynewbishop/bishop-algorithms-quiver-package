@Options(scope: local)

A Swift package that provides vector mathematics, numerical computing, and statistical operations.

## Overview

Quiver expands the Swift ecosystem with a native, Swift-first approach to vector mathematics and numerical computing. By building directly on Swift's powerful type system and syntax, Quiver creates an intuitive bridge between traditional array operations and advanced mathematical concepts. Built as an extension on the standard `Array` type, the framework embraces Swift's emphasis on readability and expressiveness, offering mathematical operations that feel natural to iOS and macOS developers.

### Data science in Swift

As Swift continues to expand beyond app development into domains like server-side computing, machine learning, and data analysis, the need for robust mathematical tools becomes increasingly important. Quiver serves as a foundation for data science workflows in Swift, enabling operations that are fundamental to fields like computer vision, game development, machine learning, and scientific computing.

### Learn by Example

This framework is companion to [Swift Algorithms & Data Structures](https://waynewbishop.github.io/swift-algorithms/), a comprehensive guide that teaches algorithmic thinking through hands-on Swift examples.
