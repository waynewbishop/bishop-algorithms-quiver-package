# Design Principles

Quiver was built with several core principles that shape its API and implementation. 

## Overview

Quiver extends Swift's standard `Array` type rather than creating custom container types. This approach offers several advantages:

- **No conversion overhead**: Work directly with Swift arrays without the need to convert between specialized data types.
- **Seamless integration**: Quiver operations can be easily integrated into existing codebases that already use Swift arrays.
- **Familiar syntax**: By extending the native Array type, Quiver maintains the syntax and behavior Swift developers already know.
- **Full access to standard library**: All of Swift's built-in array methods remain available alongside Quiver's extensions.

This design choice means you can easily chain native Swift operations with Quiver's mathematical capabilities:

```swift
// Combine Swift's filter with Quiver's vector operations
let filtered = someArray.filter { $0 > 0 }.normalized
```

### Type Safety

Quiver embraces Swift's strong type system to ensure correctness while maintaining flexibility:

- **Generic constraints**: Operations are constrained to appropriate types using Swift's generic system.
- **Compile-time guarantees**: Many potential errors are caught at compile time rather than runtime.
- **Protocol-based design**: By using protocols like `Numeric`, `FloatingPoint`, and `Comparable`, Quiver provides operations that work across different numeric types.
- **Type-specific optimizations**: Some operations are specialized for certain types to ensure correctness and performance.

For example, division operations are only available for arrays with floating-point elements, preventing unexpected integer division behavior.

### Error Handling

Mathematical operations sometimes require specific conditions to be valid. Quiver handles error conditions clearly:

- **Descriptive preconditions**: When operations cannot be completed safely (such as when array dimensions don't match), Quiver fails with clear error messages.
- **Consistent validation**: Similar operations use consistent validation approaches throughout the library.
- **Optional returns**: Functions that might not be able to produce a result (such as statistical operations on empty arrays) return optional values rather than crashing.

This approach helps developers quickly identify and fix issues:

```swift
// This will trigger a precondition failure with the message:
// "Vectors must have the same dimension"
let a = [1, 2, 3]
let b = [4, 5]
let sum = a + b // ‚ùå Different dimensions
```

### Performance Considerations

Quiver balances readability and performance to create a library that's both easy to use and efficient:

- **Minimized copying**: Array operations use views where appropriate to avoid unnecessary copying of data.
- **Optimized implementations**: Common operations have been implemented with performance in mind.
- **Lazy evaluation**: Some operations are performed lazily to avoid unnecessary computation.
- **Memory efficiency**: The library is designed to minimize memory overhead for array operations.

While Quiver prioritizes clean API design over maximum performance, it's still efficient for most use cases. For extremely performance-critical applications, specialized libraries like Accelerate might be more appropriate, but Quiver offers a better balance of usability and performance.

### Educational Focus

Quiver was designed with an educational component in mind:

- **Clear implementation**: The code is written to be readable and understandable, not just efficient.
- **Conceptual mapping**: Operations closely match mathematical concepts, making it easier to translate mathematical formulas into code.
- **Discoverable API**: Method names and parameters are chosen to make functionality easy to discover through code completion.
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Each operation is documented with examples and explanations of the underlying mathematical concepts.

This educational focus makes Quiver an excellent tool for learning about vector mathematics and numerical computing in Swift.

### Swift-first API Design

Unlike libraries that are ports from other languages, Quiver was designed from the ground up for Swift:

- **Swift idioms**: The API follows Swift naming conventions and patterns.
- **Swift language features**: Quiver takes advantage of Swift features like operator overloading, protocol extensions, and type inference.
- **Apple platform integration**: The library works well with other Apple frameworks and Swift libraries.
- **SwiftUI compatibility**: Array operations can be easily used in SwiftUI data flows.

This Swift-first approach means that Quiver feels like a natural extension of the language rather than a foreign library.

### Modular Architecture

Quiver's implementation uses a modular approach:

- **Public extensions**: User-facing functionality is implemented as extensions to `Array`.
- **Internal implementation**: Core logic is implemented in internal types like `_Vector`.
- **Feature grouping**: Related functionality is grouped together for easier comprehension and maintenance.

This architecture keeps the public API clean while allowing for complex internal implementations that don't leak implementation details.

### NumPy Inspiration

While Quiver is Swift-first, it takes inspiration from NumPy's powerful and expressive API:

- **Familiar operations**: Developers coming from Python/NumPy will recognize many operations.
- **Similar naming**: Where it makes sense, Quiver adopts similar naming conventions to NumPy.
- **Conceptual alignment**: Quiver implements similar concepts like broadcasting, element-wise operations, and statistical functions.

This inspiration helps bridge the gap for developers moving between Python and Swift for numerical computing tasks.
